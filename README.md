# 📝 To-Do List App (C Language)

A simple **command-line To-Do List application** written in **C**, allowing you to manage your daily tasks directly from the terminal.
It supports adding, viewing, and deleting tasks, with all data stored in a local text file (`todo.txt`).

---

## 🚀 Features

* ➕ **Add new tasks**
* 📋 **View all tasks**
* ❌ **Delete tasks by number**
* 💾 **Persistent storage** — tasks are saved in `todo.txt`
* 🖥️ Works on both **Windows** and **Linux**

---

## 🧩 How It Works

Each task is stored as a new line in `todo.txt`.
When you:

* Add → the task is appended to the file
* View → reads all lines and displays them
* Delete → rewrites the file without the selected task
